# Cins-Biscuits
Deep Learning is becoming a very popular subset of machine learning due to its high level of performance across many types of data. A great way to use deep learning to classify images is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN). The Tensorflow library in Python makes it pretty simple to build a CNN. The main purpose of this experiment, training biscuits and separate them into two categories. Shape and Type of made in our experiment, we have two shapes of biscuits, round and rectangular. We also have two types as Cocoa Biscuits and Normal (Milky) Biscuits. In our experiment we start with collecting data and labeling after that we classify images and train that with the position (label) argument. So our last stage is Real-time classification images with the open-cv library.
